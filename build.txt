In order to run the project, simply load up the project in your favorite editor
and create a file to contain the instructions for your maze. Extend JFXApp and
create a Maze object initialized with the path to your maze as a text file.
Rules are a set of instructions concatenated together. No new lines are
necessary. Then, run the PiconotParser on the rules, then running the evaluator
on the result from the parser. Finally, use 'listRules' from the semantics
library, passing that to the Picobot object.
