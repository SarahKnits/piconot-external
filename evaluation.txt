Team Three

Throughout writing the external DSL, we realized we had to wrap many of our
parsed strings in case classes in order to represent an AST. We also found
that using an AST makes keep track of state difficult. We ended up recursively
keeping track of state, using pattern matching to strip off layers from the AST
and add to some accumulator.

We feel that our syntax changed 2/10. We were able to stick to much of the
original design, having only to clean up some of the more verbose rules
in the grammar and figuring out how to keep track of state.
